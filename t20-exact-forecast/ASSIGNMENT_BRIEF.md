# Full assignment brief and interpretation

The full text below was supplied for this revision. It replaces the earlier excerpt as the complete assignment reference. The original wording is preserved, including the conflicting model names.

## How I handled the ambiguity

The goal and explicit model-run requirement name **GPT-5.5-high or Claude Opus 4.7**. The target-outcome paragraph instead names **GPT-6-astra-high or Claude Fable 5.1**. I treat the repeated goal/run requirement as the primary target and report the other pair separately. This is my interpretation, not a clarification received from Collinear.

Both pairs were evaluated. The evidence shows clear failures of the goal-line pair. It does not establish a clean failure of the newer pair: four of five historical trials pass, the historical miss is borderline, and all four fresh newer-pair trials pass in the [current-version replication](REPLICATION_REPORT.md). If that newer-pair requirement controls, this submitted record does not satisfy it. See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md#12-i-reported-the-passes-and-the-interruptions-as-part-of-the-result).

The brief also emphasizes the candidate's approach, assumptions, resolution of ambiguity and ownership. [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md), [ASSUMPTIONS.md](ASSUMPTIONS.md) and [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) explain those choices using the recorded work. The architecture figures support those explanations rather than replace the runnable artifacts.

## Supplied text

Candidate Assignment: Build a Net-New Long-Horizon Hard-but-fair Task
Goal: Create one fair task that exposes a substantive failure in GPT-5.5-high or Claude Opus 4.7 with their native harnesses.

We care about how you approach the problem, make reasonable assumptions and resolve the ambiguity. You will be evaluated on those dimensions more than if you got to the right solution. We are looking for high-agency, high-ownership people who have a bias for action.
P.S. We have seen 1000+ assignments so please don’t one shot this, we know how Claude thinks, we want to see how you think :)
Create one original, long-horizon agent task in Harbor format. The task should be difficult because it requires planning, inspection, state tracking, debugging, verification, and iterative tool use, not because of brittle formatting, missing dependencies, vague instructions, or hidden tricks.The target outcome is a clean, reproducible, evidence-backed failure from GPT-6-astra-high or Claude Fable 5.1, while the task remains solvable by the included oracle solution. It should also be a task which has some connection to reality. 
A fair failure is:
Solvable: A competent human or strong long-horizon agent can solve it from the provided files and instructions. The included oracle solution must pass.
Unambiguous: The instruction says what final artifact or state is required, what constraints matter, and what success looks like.
Substantive: The model fails because of a real capability gap: multi-step reasoning, tool-use discipline, data/code forensics, planning under constraints, environment understanding, or verification discipline.
Reproducible: A fresh checkout builds and runs without private machine state. Any network, secrets, model calls, or special resources are explicitly declared.
Non-brittle: The verifier checks meaningful task outcomes, not superficial strings or formatting artifacts. Disqualifying unfair failures include impossible tasks, missing dependencies, broken Dockerfiles, random network behavior, hidden requirements, copied benchmark tasks, leaked solutions, brittle exact-string grading, and failures caused only by too-short time limits.
A good task should require several linked steps. It should not be solvable by one obvious command or by reading a single small file.It should include at least three meaningful subgoals, realistic seed artifacts, hypothesis formation, verification, and a durable final deliverable such as a code patch, repaired dataset, analysis report, configured service, migrated state, or validated workflow.
Submit a zip file or repository containing exactly one task directory unless otherwise approved. Use a stable slug such as collinear-candidate/<task-name>.Required contents:
- instruction.md: clear task prompt, constraints, files to inspect, and expected deliverable.
- task.toml: Harbor metadata, timeouts, resource requirements, network policy, authorship, and category.
- environment/Dockerfile or environment/docker-compose.yaml: pinned, reproducible environment.
- tests/test.sh: verifier entrypoint that writes /logs/verifier/reward.txt or /logs/verifier/reward.json.
- tests/test_*.py or grader files: functional checks, fixtures, metrics, or judge logic.
- solution/solve.sh: oracle solution that passes the verifier.
- Seed files: codebase, logs, datasets, configs, mock services, docs, schemas, or databases as needed.
- README.md or RUN_REPORT.md: task idea, fairness rationale, why this is an economically viable/real task, model runs, verifier design, limitations, and reproduction commands.
Minimum commands to include:
harbor run -p ./<task-dir> -a oracle
harbor run -p ./<task-dir> -a <agent> -m <gpt-5.5-high-or-opus-4.7>
harbor view ./jobs
The verifier must check the core success criteria. You can use programmatic verifiers or agentic judges. Please avoid LLM as a Judge judging a trajectory.For multi-criterion grading, prefer reward.json, for example:
{
 "overall": 0.0,
 "functional_correctness": 0.0,
 "constraint_satisfaction": 0.0,
 "robustness": 0.0,
 "artifact_quality": 0.0
}
Make sure that your failure is not a false positive or negative.
The task must be newly created for this exercise.No direct ports of SWE-bench, Terminal-Bench, public CTFs, Kaggle notebooks, coding challenges, public benchmark tasks, public issues, or previous Collinear tasks. Open-source libraries and small public datasets are allowed when properly licensed and transformed into a genuinely new task scenario.Include a short provenance note explaining what was created from scratch and what external sources were used.
Feel free to take any domain of your choice: Coding, Finance, MCP Tool Calling, <Literally anything>
Run GPT-5.5-high or Claude Opus 4.7 (you can use harbor on prem) using the codex or claude code harness. Feel free to contact to adit@collinear.ai for API credits. A strong submission includes 1 model trials or clear pass/fail logs with the model failing on atlease one critical thing. Include a short failure analysis: wrong hypothesis, incomplete inspection, bad state tracking, brittle patch, skipped verification, report hallucination, or other substantive failure.
